Had to use a performance mod & sound fix to make it all happen.

Performance mod (Nexusmods [vulkan wrapper mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/153?tab=files)) you only need to add 3 .dll files in your gamefolder. Choose the experimental version in Nexusmods.

Sound fix you need to replace 2 files named Xaudio2_9 & run a .reg file within winlator container (May fix sound in other games too, always keep the original files backed up somewhere) One is located in c:/windows/system32 & the other one in c:/windows/syswow64.

Settings winlator & more gameplay see linked video. Don't forget to set ingame graphic settings as show in that video. Also change Anisotropic level to x16 (ingame graphic setting)
